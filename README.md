## Abstract

It has been an intriguing problem to analyze the pattern of check-in and 
check-out activities of hotels, which can provide insights for hotel 
management, guest flow triage, and so on. In this work, we use different 
approaches to model the probability distribution of hotel check-in and 
check-out activities, based on a real-world dataset that contains multiple 
hotel transactions. We also apply the probability distribution models to a 
hotel management system (HMS) coverage problem.
